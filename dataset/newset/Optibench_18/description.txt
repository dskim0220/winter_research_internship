On production line 3, each worker produces 6 smartphones, 7 tablets, and 5 laptops per hour. On production line 4, each worker produces 5 smartphones, 8 tablets, and 6 laptops per hour. The company needs to produce at least 1000 smartphones, 800 tablets, and 600 laptops daily. The production lines can only be operated or shut down at the same time. Determine the minimum number of hours needed to meet the daily demand. There are a total of 50 workers available. Each production line can be staffed by up to 20 workers at a time. The company wants to ensure that at least one production line is fully staffed (20 workers) if it is operational. Each production line has different productivity rates for each device.
