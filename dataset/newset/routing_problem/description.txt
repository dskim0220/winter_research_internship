[Problem Definition] Multi-Path Optimization on an Octagonal Grid1. Background and EnvironmentSpace: An octagonal grid layer supporting 8-directional movement.Input: A set of $N$ input ports $I = \{(x_1, y_1), \dots, (x_n, y_n)\}$ and a set of $N$ output ports $O = \{(x'_1, y'_1), \dots, (x'_n, y'_n)\}$.Objective: Generate $N$ independent paths, each originating from an input port and terminating at a unique output port.2. Objective FunctionMinimize the weighted sum of the total path length and the total number of turns across all $N$ paths:$$\text{Minimize } \sum_{i=1}^{N} (\text{Length}_i + \omega \cdot \text{TurnCount}_i)$$(where $\omega$ represents the penalty cost per turn)3. ConstraintsPath Disjointness: Each node and edge on the grid layer can be occupied by only one path (no re-use or sharing).Non-crossing Condition: Paths must not cross or overlap each other in the 2D plane.Movement Limitations: From any given node, movement is restricted to 8 adjacent directions (horizontal, vertical, and the four diagonals).Curvature Constraint: Any edge along a path cannot deviate by more than 45 degrees from the direction of the previous edge. Consequently, sharp turns of 90 degrees or more, as well as U-turns (180 degrees), are prohibited.Minimum Clearance: A minimum perpendicular distance of $l_e \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ must be maintained between any two paths (where $l_e$ denotes the unit length of a grid edge).4. OutputOutput the set of $N$ paths that satisfy all the above conditions. If no such combination of paths exists, the problem is determined to be Infeasible.[Terminology Guide]Infeasible: A state where no solution exists that satisfies all given constraints.Turn Penalty ($\omega$): An additional cost incurred whenever a path changes direction. A higher $\omega$ value incentivizes the generation of straighter paths.Clearance: The minimum safety distance required between paths to prevent interference or signal coupling. Visualization Module Requirements
The solver must include a Python-based visualization module using Matplotlib or Plotly. Given a .txt file containing the coordinates of the generated paths, the script should automatically parse the data and render a 2D plot. The plot must clearly illustrate the $N$ paths on an octagonal grid, ensuring that geometric constraints (e.g., $45^\circ$ turns and clearance) are visually verifiable.
