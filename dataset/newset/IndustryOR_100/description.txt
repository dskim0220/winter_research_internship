In network communication services, bandwidth plays an important role. Below is a bandwidth communication table between several communication nodes, showing the bandwidth between any two nodes. If two nodes cannot be directly connected, the corresponding bandwidth is $0$. It is required to establish a link between node $A$ and node $E$ that must pass through service node $C$ (without loops). The bandwidth of this link is defined as the minimum bandwidth value on the link. 

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
& A & B & C & D & E \\
\hline
A & 0 & 90 & 85 & 0 & 65 \\
\hline
B & 95 & 0 & 70 & 65 & 34 \\
\hline
C & 60 & 0 & 0 & 88 & 80 \\
\hline
D & 67 & 30 & 25 & 0 & 84 \\
\hline
E & 0 & 51 & 0 & 56 & 0 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The sum of bandwith is at least 100. 

If the direct link between A and E is selected, the transmission efficiency of the path decreases by 10% due to the long distance between the two nodes.

The transmission efficiency of the path between D and E is 96%.

The transmission efficiency of the path between A and B is 90%.

Please propose a reasonable link arrangement to maximize the bandwidth of this link and find out the maximum bandwidth.
