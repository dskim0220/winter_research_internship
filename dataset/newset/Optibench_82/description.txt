The number of employees needed in a post office varies depending on the day of the week, as listed as Monday 15, Tuesday 13, Wednesday 15, Thursday 18, Friday 14, Saturday 16 and Sunday 10. 
Employees work five consecutive days and have the next two days off. 
It becomes necessary to organize groups of employees to work in different shifts, so that the number of employees required is satisfied every day of the week. 
The objective is to employ the minimum number of workers.
The difference between the number of employees who start their five-day shift on Monday and those who start on Wednesday must be less than 7.
At least three employees must be assigned to a schedule where they have both Sunday and Monday off consecutively.
