A logistics company is managing the distribution of three types of goods: GoodsX, GoodsY, and GoodsZ. The company needs to decide how many trucks to allocate for each type of good to optimize delivery efficiency and minimize costs. Additionally, the company can invest in route optimization software to reduce travel time and fuel consumption, which affects the cost and efficiency of each delivery. The initial cost per truck for GoodsX is $1,000, but with optimization, the cost decreases by $10 for every $100 invested in optimization. The initial cost per truck for GoodsY is $1,200, and with optimization, the cost decreases by $12 for every $100 invested in optimization. The initial cost per truck for GoodsZ is $1,500, and with optimization, the cost decreases by $15 for every $100 invested in optimization. The company aims to minimize the total delivery cost for all goods. The company has a total of 50 trucks available for allocation. The budget for route optimization software is $10,000. Due to contractual obligations, the company must allocate at least 10 trucks for GoodsX and 15 trucks for GoodsY. The company wants to ensure that the total investment in optimization does not exceed the total cost savings from using the software. The reduction in delivery costs is linearly proportional to the amount of investment in route optimization software for each type of good.
