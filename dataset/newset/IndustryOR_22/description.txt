A company plans to produce 3 types of products $A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}$. It can produce for 22 days in a month. The following table gives the maximum demand (unit $=100 \mathrm{~kg}$), price ($\$ / 100 \mathrm{Kg}$), production cost (per 100Kg product), and production quota (the maximum number of 100kg units that can be produced in one day if all production lines are devoted to this product).

| Product | $A_{1}$ | $A_{2}$ | $A_{3}$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Maximum Demand | 5300 | 4500 | 5400 |
| Selling Price | $124$ | $109$ | $115$ |
| Production Cost | $73.30$ | $52.90$ | $65.40$ |
| Production Quota | 500 | 450 | 550 |

The fixed activation cost of the production line is as follows:

| Product | $A_{1}$ | $A_{2}$ | $A_{3}$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Activation Cost | $170000$ | $150000$ | $100000$ |

Minimum production batch:

$$
\begin{array}{c|ccc}
Product & A_{1} & A_{2} & A_{3} \\
\hline
Minimum Batch & 20 & 20 & 16
\end{array}
$$

Product $A_{1}$ can be produced at most 22 days.

The total production of $A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}$ does not exceed 1,210 tons.

If the company decides to produce $A_{1}$, then it must activate production the production lines at least 57 minutes to produce $A_{1}$.

Please formulate an operations research model to determine a production plan that maximizes total revenue while accommodating fixed activation costs and minimum production batch constraints.
