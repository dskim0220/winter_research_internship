    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.0,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The provided JSON contains several issues including incorrect variable types, logical errors, and missing constraints. The 'query' fields do not match the 'LaTeX' formulations, and the mathematical integrity is compromised.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "The 'query' fields contain placeholders (e.g., 0) instead of actual numbers. There are no hallucinations listed as the 'query' fields are not faithfully extracted from the problem description.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerical values in the 'query' fields are placeholders (e.g., 0) and do not match the 'LaTeX' formulations. This indicates zero-filling and lack of fidelity.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "No Big-M links are provided in the 'LaTeX' formulations, which is required based on the logic in the queries. Additionally, the constraints related to minimum batch and activation time are missing.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The objective function does not follow the MILP standard due to the presence of non-linear terms (e.g., (Price - Cost) * Quantity).",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "There is no dimensional analysis provided in the 'LaTeX' formulations, making it impossible to verify unit consistency.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "The constraints are poorly defined and do not align with the provided logic. For example, the constraint 'At least two teams are required to be assigned to the AppX development project.' is not correctly formulated in the 'LaTeX' section. Similarly, the constraints regarding the total number of teams assigned to specific products are not properly represented."
