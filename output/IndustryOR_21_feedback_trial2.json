    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.0,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The provided JSON contains numerous errors and logical inconsistencies that prevent it from being a valid mathematical model. Specifically, the constraints and variable definitions do not align with the problem description, and many parameters are set to zero or incorrect values.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "The 'query' fields contain fabricated or irrelevant information. For example, the 'Fixed_Costs' parameter is not defined, and the 'Minimum Batch' and 'Activation Time' are not mentioned in the problem description.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerous numeric values are either missing or set to zero, such as the fixed costs, minimum batches, and activation times. Additionally, some constraints reference undefined parameters like'm_A' and'm_B'.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "There are no Big-M constraints present in the provided model, which contradicts the problem description where specific logical conditions require them. For instance, the condition that if Supplier A is ordered, Supplier B must also be ordered does not have a corresponding constraint.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The model is not linear due to the presence of binary variables and the lack of proper coupling constraints. The objective function and constraints do not follow the principles of linear programming.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "The dimensional consistency check is impossible without actual values for quantities and costs. However, assuming typical units, the model appears to be dimensionally consistent but this cannot be verified without concrete values.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "The constraints are poorly formulated and do not match the logical conditions described in the problem. For example, the constraints involving Supplier A and Supplier B do not correctly reflect the logical requirements given in the problem description."
