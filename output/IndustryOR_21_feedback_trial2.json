{
    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.0,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The model contains several issues including incorrect variable types, logical inconsistencies, and missing constraints. Additionally, some key numerical values are missing or set to zero.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "The 'query' fields do not match the problem description. Specifically, 'orders_A', 'orders_B', and 'orders_C' should be 'orders_A', 'orders_B', and 'orders_C' respectively. Also, 'orders_A' should be 'orders_A' and not 'orders_A'.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerical values in 'query' fields do not match those in 'LaTeX'. For example, 'Supplier_A_Price' should be '120', but it is '120'. Similarly, 'MinTables' should be '150', but it is '150'. However, 'MaxTables' should be '600', but it is '600'. This indicates that some values are missing or set to zero.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "No Big-M constraints are correctly formulated based on the logic provided in the queries. For instance, the constraint 'SupplierABDependent' should link 'orders_A' and 'orders_B' with a Big-M value, but this is not present.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The model does not follow the standard Linear Programming (LP) rules due to the presence of binary variables in the objective function. The objective function should only include continuous or integer variables.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "The unit of measurement is consistent throughout the model, assuming all quantities are in the same unit (tons).",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "The constraints are logically inconsistent and do not fully capture the relationships described in the problem. For example, the constraint 'AtLeastSevenOrders' should ensure that the sum of orders from A, B, and C is at least 7, but it does not account for the minimum order requirements from specific suppliers. The constraint 'SupplierABDependent' should enforce that if an order is made from Supplier A, then at least 3 orders must be made from Supplier B, which is not correctly implemented. The constraint 'SumOfOrdersFromAAndB' should ensure that the sum of orders from A and B is at least 25, but it does not consider the minimum order requirement from Supplier A. The constraint 'SumOfOrdersFromBAndC' should ensure that the sum of orders from B and C is at least 30, but it does not consider the minimum order requirement from Supplier B."
