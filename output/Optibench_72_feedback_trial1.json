    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.5,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The model largely follows the problem description but lacks specific numerical values for some parameters and constraints. The grounding check and logical coupling check are mostly accurate, but the data fidelity check reveals discrepancies.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "No hallucinations detected.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerical discrepancies found in the 'LaTeX' fields compared to the 'query' fields. Specifically, the 'MARKETING_COST_PER_TEAM_APPX', 'MARKETING_COST_PER_TEAM_APPY', 'MARKETING_COST_PER_TEAM_APPZ', 'MARKETING_COST_PER_TEAM_APPW', and 'MARKETING_COST_PER_TEAM_APPV' parameters do not match their respective 'query' values. Additionally, the 'MIN_APPX_APPY_RATIO' parameter does not have a corresponding 'query' value.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "No Big-M links are present in the current formulation, so this check is inconclusive.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The model appears linear given the continuous nature of the variables and the absence of variable-to-variable multiplication.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "Unit consistency is maintained throughout the model.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "Constraints are correctly formulated based on the problem description, but some constraints lack specific numerical values which could affect their applicability. For example, the 'MIN_APPX_APPY_RATIO' constraint is missing a 'query' value, and the 'MAX_APPX_APPY_APPW_APPV_TEAMS' and 'MAX_APPZ_APPV_TEAMS' constraints lack specific numerical limits."
