    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.0,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The provided JSON contains several issues including incorrect variable types, logical errors, and missing constraints. The 'query' fields do not match the 'LaTeX' formulations, and the mathematical integrity is compromised.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "The 'query' fields contain placeholders (e.g., 0) instead of actual numbers. There are no hallucinations listed as the 'query' does not match the 'LaTeX' formulations.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerical data is missing or set to 0. For example, the 'EstimatedRevenue_{APPX}', 'DevelopmentCost_{APPX}', and 'MarketingCost_{APPX}' parameters are set to 0.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "No Big-M links are provided in the 'LaTeX' formulations, which is required based on the logic in the queries.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "Variable-to-variable multiplication is present, violating the MILP standard. For instance, the objective function includes terms like 'Price - Cost', which should be linearized.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "No dimensional analysis is performed in the provided JSON.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "The constraints are not correctly mapped to the 'LaTeX' formulations. For example, the minimum batch constraint for AppX is not properly represented, and the total production limit constraint is not included."
