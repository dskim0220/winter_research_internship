    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.0,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The provided JSON contains numerous issues that need to be addressed. The queries do not accurately reflect the problem description, and the mathematical formulation lacks integrity.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "The queries do not match the problem description. The problem description mentions specific costs and requirements, but the queries are placeholders without actual values.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerous numeric placeholders (e.g., 0) are used in the LaTeX formulas, which do not correspond to the actual values mentioned in the problem description.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "No Big-M constraints are provided, as the problem does not specify any fixed costs or minimum batch sizes.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The formulation appears linear, but the absence of specific values makes it impossible to verify.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "No dimensional analysis is performed, and the units are not consistent with the problem description.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "The constraints are poorly defined and do not align with the problem description. For example, the requirement to open at least one warehouse is not clearly represented, and the relationship between binary and continuous variables is unclear."
