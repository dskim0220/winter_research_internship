{
    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.5,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The model largely follows the problem description but lacks specific numerical values in some parameters and constraints. There are also logical errors in the formulation of some constraints.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "No hallucinations detected. All 'query' fields are faithful extracts from the problem description.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerical values in 'query' fields do not match those in 'LaTeX'. Some parameters like 'Raw Material Cost', 'Unit Price', and 'Effective Machine Hours' are placeholders (0).",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "No Big-M links are present in the current formulation. The model does not account for fixed costs or minimum batch requirements.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The model appears linear with no variable-to-variable multiplication. However, the presence of binary variables and continuous variables suggests potential non-linearity.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "Unit consistency is maintained throughout the model. However, the conversion of machine hours to other units is not explicitly shown.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "Constraints are poorly formulated and lack clarity. For example, the total production limit is not clearly defined in terms of units (tons or pieces). Additionally, the constraints regarding the production limits of Products I and III are not properly linked to the production quantities."
