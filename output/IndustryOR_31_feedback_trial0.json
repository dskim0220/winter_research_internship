    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.0,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The provided JSON contains several issues including incorrect variable types, logical errors, and missing constraints. Additionally, the numerical fidelity check reveals discrepancies between the queries and the LaTeX formulations.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "The 'query' fields do not match the problem description. The problem description mentions specific constraints and requirements that are not reflected in the 'query' fields.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerical mismatches and zero-filling are evident. For example, the fixed costs are not included in the 'query' fields, and some numerical values are placeholders (e.g., 0).",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "No Big-M constraints are provided, which is required for the logical linking between binary and continuous variables based on the problem description.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The objective function does not follow the MILP standard, as it includes variable-to-variable multiplication (e.g., (Price - Cost) * Quantity).",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "There is no dimensional analysis performed, and the unit consistency is not checked.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "The constraints are not correctly mapped to the 'query' fields. For instance, the total production limits and minimum batch requirements are not properly addressed in the 'LaTeX' formulation."
