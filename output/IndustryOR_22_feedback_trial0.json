    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.50,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The model attempts to capture the essence of the problem but contains several issues. The binary variables \(x_{A1}\), \(x_{A2}\), and \(x_{A3}\) are incorrectly formulated. The objective function and constraints need significant adjustments to ensure they accurately reflect the problem's requirements. Additionally, there are inconsistencies in the dimensional analysis and logical coupling between variables.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "The model uses arbitrary constants such as 5300, 4500, 5400, 124, 109, 115, 73.30, 52.90, 65.40, 170000, 150000, 100000, 20, 20, 16, and 22. These values should be derived from the problem statement or are not explicitly mentioned.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "Binary variables \(x_{A1}\), \(x_{A2}\), and \(x_{A3}\) are incorrectly linked with continuous variables. The Big-M method is used without proper justification, which requires human verification.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The model includes non-linear terms such as \(x_{A1} \cdot \frac{T_{A1}}{60}\) and \(x_{A1} \cdot 5300\). These terms violate the standard linear programming (LP) formulation.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "There are dimensional inconsistencies in the objective function and constraints. For example, the term \(x_{A1} \cdot 5300\) has units of \(100 \mathrm{~kg} \cdot \mathrm{days}\), which do not match the units in the rest of the equation.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "The constraints \(x_{A1} + x_{A2} + x_{A3} \leq \frac{L}{53}\) and \(x_{A1} \geq 1 + x_{A1} \cdot \frac{T_{A1}}{60}\) are not correctly formulated. The first constraint should be based on the total production limit in tons, and the second constraint should be adjusted to ensure logical consistency."
