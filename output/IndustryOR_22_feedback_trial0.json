    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.0,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The provided JSON contains significant errors and omissions that violate the guidelines. The model does not correctly map the queries to the LaTeX formulations, lacks critical constraints, and uses placeholder values where actual data is required.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "The 'query' fields do not match the problem description. The queries are placeholders and do not reflect the actual problem requirements.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerous discrepancies exist between the 'query' and 'LaTeX' fields. Placeholder values and incorrect numerical data are present.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "No Big-M constraints are included, which is a requirement given the presence of minimum batch and activation time constraints.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The model is not linear due to the presence of binary variables and the lack of proper coupling constraints.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "The unit conversion from tons to 100 kg is not handled properly, leading to dimensional inconsistencies.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "The constraints are not correctly mapped to the queries. For example, the total production limit is not reflected in the objective function or constraints, and the activation time constraint is missing. Additionally, the minimum batch constraints are not properly formulated."
