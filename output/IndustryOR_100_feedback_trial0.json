    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.0,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The provided JSON contains significant issues with grounding, mapping, and logical integrity. The queries do not accurately reflect the problem description, and the constraints are not correctly formulated.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "The 'query' fields do not match the problem description. The queries are placeholders and do not correspond to the actual problem requirements.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerical values in the 'query' fields do not match those in the 'LaTeX' fields. For example, the 'query' for'sum_of_bandwidth_at_least_100' is 'The sum of bandwith is at least 100.' but the 'LaTeX' field uses 'x_{AE} \\\\geq 100', which is correct. However, other queries like 'transmission_efficiency_A_E_decreases_by_10_percent' do not have matching 'LaTeX' fields.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "No Big-M links are present in the constraints, as required by the problem description. The constraints do not enforce the logical conditions specified in the queries.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The objective function and constraints are linear, which is correct. However, the presence of non-linear terms (like percentages) in the queries makes it difficult to ensure linearity.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "Unit consistency is not checked in the provided JSON. The units (Mbps, percent) need to be consistent across the entire model.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "The constraints are not correctly formulated based on the problem description. For example, the'sum_of_bandwidth_at_least_100' constraint should be 'x_{AE} \\\\geq 100' but is incorrectly written as 'x_{AE} \\\\geq 100'. The 'transmission_efficiency_A_E_decreases_by_10_percent' constraint is missing in the LaTeX formulation."
