    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.0,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The provided JSON contains several issues that need to be addressed. The queries and LaTeX formulations do not align with the problem description, and some logical constraints are missing.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "The 'query' fields do not match the problem description. The following queries are hallucinations or do not correspond to the problem statement:\\n- 'Number of input/output ports'\\n- 'Penalty cost per turn'\\n- 'Minimum perpendicular distance between paths'",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerical values in the 'query' fields do not match those in the LaTeX formulations. For example, the 'Number of input/output ports' is set to 'N', but the LaTeX uses 'N' which is redundant. Similarly, 'Penalty cost per turn' is set to '\\\\omega', but the LaTeX uses '\\\\omega'. The 'Minimum perpendicular distance between paths' is set to '\\\\frac{l_e \\\\sqrt{2}}{2}', but the LaTeX uses 'l_e \\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2}}{2}' which is correct.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "No Big-M links are present in the constraints, as the problem does not specify any fixed costs or minimum batch sizes.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The objective function and constraints are linear, adhering to the MILP standard.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "The dimensional analysis is consistent, with all units being correctly represented.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "The constraints are logically sound and correctly mapped to their LaTeX counterparts. However, the following constraints lack clarity or are not directly related to the problem description:\\n- 'path_disjointness': This constraint ensures that each node and edge is used by at most one path, which is a logical requirement but lacks specific numerical values.\\n- 'non_crossing_condition': This constraint ensures that paths do not intersect, which is a geometric requirement but lacks specific numerical values.\\n-'movement_limitations': This constraint ensures that movement is within the allowed directions, which is a logical requirement but lacks specific numerical values.\\n- 'curvature_constraint': This constraint ensures that the curvature constraint is satisfied, which is a logical requirement but lacks specific numerical values."
