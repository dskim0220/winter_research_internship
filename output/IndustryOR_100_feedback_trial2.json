    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.0,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The model lacks grounding with respect to the problem description and contains logical errors.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "The 'query' fields do not match the problem description. The problem description mentions specific constraints and objectives, but the JSON does not reflect these correctly.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerical values in the 'query' fields do not align with the LaTeX expressions. For example, the sum_bandwidth constraint should be 100, but it is set to P_sum which is undefined.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "No Big-M constraints are present, which is a requirement given the problem description. Additionally, the objective function does not correctly reflect the problem statement.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The model is not linear due to the presence of binary variables and the objective function structure.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "The problem involves continuous quantities (bandwidth), but the model uses integer and binary variables, which is inconsistent.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "The sum_bandwidth_constraint is incorrect. The problem requires the total bandwidth to be at least 100, not P_sum. The objective function does not correctly reflect the problem statement. There are no Big-M constraints present, which is a requirement given the problem description."
