{
    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.0,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The model contains several issues including incorrect variable types, logical inconsistencies, and missing constraints. Additionally, some key numerical values are missing or set to zero.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "The 'orders_A', 'orders_B', and 'orders_C' variables should be set as Integer rather than Binary. The 'orders_A' variable should be set as Binary to correctly represent the decision to produce.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerical values in 'query' fields do not match those in 'LaTeX'. For example, 'Supplier_A_Price' should be 120, but it is set to 0. Similarly, 'MinTables', 'MaxTables', 'OrdersFromA', 'OrdersFromB', 'OrdersFromC', 'OrdersFromAAndB', 'OrdersFromBAndC', and 'OrdersFromAOrBOrC' are set to 0 or placeholders.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "No Big-M constraints are present in the model, which is expected since the problem does not specify minimum batch sizes or activation times.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The model is linear as there are no variable-to-variable multiplications.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "The dimensional consistency check is not applicable as the problem involves discrete quantities (orders and tables) rather than continuous physical quantities.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "The constraints are logically inconsistent and do not align with the problem description. For example, the 'AtLeastThreeOrdersFromB' constraint should be 'x_B >= 3' and not 'x_B >= M(1 - x_A)', which is not defined. Similarly, the 'SupplierABDependent' and 'SupplierBCDependent' constraints should be 'x_B >= 3' and 'x_C >= 3' respectively. The 'SumOfOrdersFromAAndB' and 'SumOfOrdersFromBAndC' constraints should be '20x_A + 15x_B >= 25' and '15x_B + 15x_C >= 30' respectively. The 'AtLeastSevenOrders' constraint should be 'x_A + x_B + x_C >= 7'. The 'MaxTablesFromA' constraint should be 'x_A <= 60'. The 'MinTablesConstraint' and 'MaxTablesConstraint' should be '20x_A + 15x_B + 15x_C >= 150' and '20x_A + 15x_B + 15x_C <= 600' respectively."
