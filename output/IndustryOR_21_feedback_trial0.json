    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.0,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The provided JSON lacks critical details and logical consistency checks, leading to a low confidence score.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "No hallucinations found, but the queries do not match the problem description. The problem description mentions specific constraints and requirements that are not fully captured in the provided JSON.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerical discrepancies exist between the queries and the LaTeX formulation. For example, the minimum batch constraints and fixed costs are not accurately represented.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "Major issues with Big-M validation. The provided constraints do not correctly link binary and continuous variables as required by the problem description.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The objective function is linear, but some constraints may introduce non-linearities due to the Big-M approach.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "No dimensional analysis provided; conversion factors or unit consistency checks are needed.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "The constraints are incomplete and do not fully capture the logical relationships described in the problem. For instance, the minimum batch constraints and activation time are not properly modeled."
