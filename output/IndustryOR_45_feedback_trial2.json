    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.0,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "Summary of accuracy and grounding.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "The problem description includes additional requirements such as 'each student can work no more than 2 shifts per week', 'no more than 3 students can be scheduled for duty each day', and 'the total duty hours of all undergraduates and graduate students are 70 hours'. These requirements are not present in the original problem statement.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Exact numerical values for wages and hours are provided in the original table, but the LaTeX formulation does not match the table entries. For example, the wage for student 1 is given as 10.0 CNY/h in the table but is incorrectly stated as 10.0 in the LaTeX.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "The Big-M linking is not clearly defined in the provided JSON. The constraints regarding the number of shifts and students per day need to be formulated with Big-M values.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The objective function and constraints do not appear to be linear. The presence of binary variables and specific constraints suggests a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, which may include non-linear terms.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "Unit consistency is not explicitly checked in the provided JSON. However, the units in the original table (hours) should be consistent with the wage units (CNY/h).",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "The constraints need detailed mapping to ensure they align with the original problem statement. For instance, the requirement that each undergraduate must work at least 8 hours per week should be converted into a constraint involving the sum of x_{ij} over days for each undergraduate. Similarly, the requirement that no more than 3 students can be scheduled for duty each day needs to be formulated as a constraint limiting the sum of x_{ij} over days for each student to 3."
