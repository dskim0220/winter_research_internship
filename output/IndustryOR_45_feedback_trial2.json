{
    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.0,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The model lacks critical details and logical consistency. There are significant issues with the grounding check, data fidelity, and logical coupling.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "The 'query' fields do not match the problem description. The 'query' placeholders are not replaced with actual numbers.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerical discrepancies between 'query' and 'LaTeX' fields. Many numbers are missing or set to 0.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "No Big-M constraints are present, which is a requirement given the problem constraints.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The model does not follow linear programming standards due to the presence of binary variables for continuous quantities.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "No dimensional analysis is performed; the model assumes all quantities are in consistent units.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "Constraints are poorly defined and do not align with the problem description. For example, the 'Total Duty Hours' constraint is incorrect and redundant."
