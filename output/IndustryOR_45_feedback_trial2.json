    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.5,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The model largely follows the problem description but lacks specific numerical values and some logical constraints are not fully addressed.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "No hallucinations found. All 'query' fields are faithful extracts from the problem description.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerical discrepancies found. Some 'query' fields contain placeholder values (e.g., 0) which should be replaced with actual numbers.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "Missing Big-M constraints for some conditions (e.g., minimum batch, activation time).",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The model appears linear, but some constraints need verification for linearity.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "Unit consistency is maintained, but conversion factors might be needed for dimensional analysis.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "1. Minimum hours constraints for students 1-4 are correctly formulated.\\n2. Maximum hours constraints for days are correctly formulated.\\n3. Maximum shifts constraints for students 5 and 6 are correctly formulated.\\n4. Total duty hours constraint is correctly formulated.\\n5. Maximum students per day constraint is correctly formulated.\\n6. Maximum hours for students 5 and 6 combined constraint is correctly formulated.\\n7. Thursday's hours limit for student 5 constraint is correctly formulated.\\n8. Gross pay objective function is correctly formulated.\\n9. Missing constraints: Minimum batch, Total Production Limit (Tons), and Activation Time are not modeled."
