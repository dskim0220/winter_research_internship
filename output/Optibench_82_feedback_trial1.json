{
    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.0,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The model contains several issues including incorrect variable types, logical errors, and missing constraints. The queries do not match the LaTeX formulations, and some key parameters are missing.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "The 'query' fields contain placeholders (e.g., 'EMPLOYEES_REQUIRED', 'MIN_DIFFERENCE', 'SUNDAY_MONDAY_PAIR') which are not present in the Problem Description. These placeholders should be replaced with actual numerical values.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerical values in queries do not match the LaTeX formulations. For example, 'EMPLOYEES_REQUIRED' is defined but does not include actual numbers, and 'MIN_DIFFERENCE' and 'SUNDAY_MONDAY_PAIR' are placeholders.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "No Big-M constraints are present in the model, which is expected given the current formulation. However, the model lacks critical constraints such as the minimum batch and total production limit.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The model appears linear, but it lacks essential constraints like the minimum batch and total production limit, which are crucial for ensuring linearity and feasibility.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "No dimensional analysis is performed in the provided model.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "Constraints are poorly formulated and do not align with the problem description. For instance, the'sum(x_{d,i} for d in {Monday, Wednesday}) <= x_{d,i} + x_{d+1,i}' constraint is unclear and does not reflect the problem requirements. Similarly, the'sum(x_{d,i} for d in {Sunday, Monday}) >= y_{d,i}' constraint is also unclear and does not correctly link the binary and continuous variables."
