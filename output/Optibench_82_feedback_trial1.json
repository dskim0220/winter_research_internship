{
    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.0,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The model contains several issues including incorrect variable types, logical errors, and missing constraints. The queries do not match the LaTeX formulations, and the mathematical integrity is compromised.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "The 'query' fields contain placeholders (e.g., 0) instead of actual numbers. There are no hallucinations as such, but the placeholders need to be replaced with actual numbers.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerical data in queries is missing or set to 0. This leads to inconsistencies between the queries and the LaTeX formulations.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "No Big-M links are provided based on the logic in the queries. The constraints related to the fixed costs and minimum batch requirements are missing.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "Variable-to-variable multiplication is observed in the objective function, violating the MILP standard. The objective function should be revised to ensure linearity.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "No dimensional analysis is performed. The units need to be consistent across the model.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "Missing constraints include 'Minimum Batch', 'Total Production Limit (Tons)', and 'Activation Time'. The constraints related to the fixed costs and minimum batch requirements are also missing. The Big-M links are not provided based on the logic in the queries."
