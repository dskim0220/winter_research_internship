{
    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.0,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The model contains several issues including incorrect variable types, logical errors, and missing constraints.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "The 'query' fields do not match the problem description. The 'query' for 'EMPLOYEES_REQUIRED', 'MIN_SUNDAY_MONDAY_PAIR', and 'DIFFERENCE_LIMIT' should contain actual numbers.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerical discrepancies found between 'query' and 'LaTeX' fields. Placeholder values like '0' are used instead of actual numbers.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "No Big-M constraints are correctly implemented based on the problem description. The 'SundayMondayPairConstraint' and 'DifferenceConstraint' need to be re-evaluated.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The model does not strictly adhere to linear constraints. Variables are mixed with continuous and binary variables without proper Big-M linking.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "No dimensional analysis is performed in the given model.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "Constraints 'EmploymentRequirement', 'SundayMondayPairConstraint', and 'DifferenceConstraint' need to be revised to align with the problem description. Specifically, the 'SundayMondayPairConstraint' and 'DifferenceConstraint' lack proper Big-M linking and logical coupling."
