{
    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.0,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The model contains several issues including incorrect variable types, logical errors, and missing constraints. The objective function does not correctly reflect the problem requirements, and some constraints are not properly formulated.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "The 'query' fields do not match the problem description. Specifically, the'shift_assignment' variable should be continuous or integer, not binary.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerical discrepancies found between 'query' and 'LaTeX'. For example, 'EMPLOYEES_REQUIRED' and 'MIN_SUNDAY_MONDAY_PAIR' are not represented in the 'LaTeX'.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "No Big-M constraints are present in the model, which is expected since the problem does not specify fixed costs or minimum batch sizes.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The model is linear as it only involves summations and comparisons.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "No dimensional analysis is performed; however, the problem does not involve physical dimensions.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "Constraints are poorly formulated and do not align with the problem description. For instance, the 'EmploymentRequirement' constraint sums over all employees for each day, which is not aligned with the problem statement. The 'MinDifferenceConstraint' and 'SundayMondayPairConstraint' also need reevaluation."
