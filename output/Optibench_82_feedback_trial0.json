{
    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.0,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The model lacks essential details and logical connections, leading to significant issues with grounding, mapping, and mathematical integrity.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "The 'query' fields do not match the problem description. The problem description provides specific employee requirements and constraints, but the JSON does not reflect these accurately.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerical discrepancies exist between the 'query' and 'LaTeX' fields. For example, the 'EMPLOYEES_REQUIRED' query lists specific numbers, but the 'LaTeX' uses placeholders (e.g., \\\\text{EMPLOYEES_REQUIRED}[i]).",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "No Big-M constraints are present to link binary and continuous variables based on the logic described in the queries.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The model contains non-linear terms due to the summation of binary variables in the objective function and constraints.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "No dimensional analysis is performed; the units are consistent within the given data but should be checked for conversion if necessary.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "The constraints are poorly formulated and do not align with the problem description. For instance, the 'EmploymentRequirement' constraint sums over all employees for each day, which is incorrect. The 'MinDifferenceConstraint' and 'SundayMondayPairConstraint' also lack proper logical coupling and may need rephrasing."
