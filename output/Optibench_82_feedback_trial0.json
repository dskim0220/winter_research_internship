{
    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.0,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The model contains several issues including incorrect variable types, logical errors, and missing constraints. The queries do not match the LaTeX formulations, and the mathematical integrity is compromised.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "The 'query' fields contain placeholders (e.g., 0) instead of actual numbers. The queries do not reflect the problem description accurately.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerical values in the 'query' fields are placeholders (e.g., 0), which do not correspond to the actual numbers in the LaTeX formulations. All numbers are set to 0.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "No Big-M constraints are present to link the binary variables with the continuous quantities as described in the queries.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The model does not include variable-to-variable multiplication, but it lacks the necessary constraints to ensure linearity.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "No dimensional analysis is performed; the units are consistent but not explicitly stated.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "The constraints do not accurately reflect the problem description. For example, the requirement for the difference between Monday and Wednesday employees to be less than 7 is not properly modeled. Additionally, the minimum batch and activation time constraints are missing."
