    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.5,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The model largely follows the problem description but lacks some critical details and logical checks.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "No hallucinations found. All 'query' fields are faithful extracts from the problem.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerical discrepancies found in the 'query' fields. Some numbers do not match the LaTeX representations. Specifically, the fixed costs should be included in the objective function.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "No Big-M constraints are present, which is expected since no minimum batch or activation time is mentioned. However, this could lead to issues with optimization.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The model appears linear, as there are no variable-to-variable multiplications.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "Unit consistency is maintained throughout the model.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "Constraints are correctly formulated, but the objective function needs adjustment. The fixed costs should be included in the objective function to maximize profit."
