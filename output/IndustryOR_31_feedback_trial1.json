    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.0,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The provided JSON contains several issues including incorrect variable types, logical errors, and missing constraints. Additionally, the numerical fidelity check reveals discrepancies between the queries and the LaTeX formulations.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "The 'query' fields do not match the problem description. The problem description mentions specific constraints and requirements that are not reflected in the 'query' fields.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerical mismatches and zero-filling are evident. For example, the fixed costs are not included in the 'query' fields, and some numerical values in the 'query' fields do not correspond to the LaTeX formulations.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "No Big-M constraints are provided, which is required for fixed costs or minimum batch sizes. The absence of such constraints indicates potential logical errors.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The objective function does not follow the standard linear form. The presence of non-linear terms like 'Price - Cost' multiplied by 'Quantity' violates the linear programming standard.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "There is no dimensional analysis performed. The unit consistency across different parameters is not checked.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "The constraints are not correctly mapped to the 'query' fields. For instance, the total production limits and minimum batch requirements are not properly addressed in the 'query' fields."
