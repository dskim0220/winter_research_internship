{
    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.5,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The model largely follows the problem description but lacks specific numerical values in some constraints and objectives. The Big-M constraints are correctly applied where applicable, but some logical conditions need clarification.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "No hallucinations found. All 'query' fields are faithful extracts from the problem description.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerical discrepancies found in the 'LaTeX' section compared to the 'query' section. Specifically, the 'Price' and 'Cost' values are missing, and some constraints use placeholders like 'h_{ij}' which should be replaced with actual values.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "Big-M constraints are correctly implemented where applicable. However, the 'FULL_LINE_MIN_WORKERS' constraint does not specify a Big-M value, which could lead to issues if not properly defined.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "All variables are treated as continuous or binary, and there is no variable-to-variable multiplication, ensuring the model remains linear.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "Unit consistency is maintained throughout the model. However, the 'MINIMUM_DEMAND' and 'PRODUCTIVITY' parameters are given in terms of devices per hour, which should be converted to a consistent unit (e.g., tons) if the objective is to minimize production time in hours.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "Constraints are generally well-mapped to the problem description. However, the following constraints need further clarification:\\n- 'Demand_Satisfaction': The 'p_{ij}' values should be replaced with actual productivity rates.\\n- 'Worker_Limitation': The '50' should be replaced with the total number of workers available.\\n- 'Line_Workers': The '20' should be replaced with the maximum number of workers per line.\\n- 'Other_Lines_Workers': The '30' should be replaced with the maximum number of workers allowed on other lines when one line is fully staffed.\\n- 'No_Three_Full': The '2' should be replaced with the maximum number of lines that can be fully staffed.\\n- 'Line_3_Workers': The '10' should be replaced with the maximum number of workers allowed on production line 3.\\n- 'Line_3_Max_Workers': The '10' should be replaced with the maximum number of workers allowed on production line 3.\\n- 'Full_Line_Min_Workers': The '20' should be replaced with the minimum number of workers required to ensure at least one line is fully staffed."
