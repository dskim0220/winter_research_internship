    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.0,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The provided JSON contains numerous issues including incorrect variable types, logical errors, and missing constraints. The 'query' fields do not match the problem description, and the 'LaTeX' formulations are inconsistent with the problem requirements.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "The 'query' fields contain placeholders and do not reflect the actual problem description. For example, 'Minimum Batch', 'Total Production Limit (Tons)', and 'Activation Time' are not addressed in the problem description.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerous numeric values in the 'query' fields are placeholders (e.g., 170000) and do not correspond to actual problem requirements. Some constraints are missing or incorrectly formulated.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "No Big-M constraints are correctly identified or implemented based on the problem description. The logic for ensuring at least one production line is fully staffed is not properly captured.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The formulation does not adhere to linear programming standards due to the presence of binary variables and non-linear relationships.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "Unit inconsistencies exist, particularly in the conversion of production quantities and worker hours into meaningful dimensions.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "The constraints are poorly defined and do not align with the problem description. For instance, the requirement to ensure at least one production line is fully staffed is not correctly represented, and the total production limit is not specified in terms of units (tons, kg, etc.)."
