    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.0,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The provided JSON contains numerous issues including incorrect variable types, logical errors, and missing constraints. The 'query' fields do not match the problem description, and the 'LaTeX' representations are often incorrect or incomplete.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "The 'query' fields are not faithful extracts from the problem description. There are several hallucinations and placeholders.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerous numeric discrepancies exist between the 'query' and 'LaTeX' fields. Many numbers are either missing or set to placeholders (e.g., 0).",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "No Big-M constraints are correctly identified or implemented based on the provided queries.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The model is not linear due to the presence of binary variables and non-linear terms.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "Unit inconsistencies are present, particularly in the conversion of hourly production rates to daily production requirements.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "The constraints are poorly defined and do not accurately reflect the problem description. For example, the 'Minimum Batch' and 'Total Production Limit (Tons)' constraints are not properly modeled, and the 'Activation Time' constraint is missing."
