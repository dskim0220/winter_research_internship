    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.5,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The model largely follows the problem description but lacks specific numerical values and some logical constraints.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "No hallucinations detected.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerical discrepancies found. The 'query' fields contain placeholder values (0) that should be replaced with actual numbers.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "No Big-M constraints are present, which is expected given the current formulation.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The model appears linear, as there are no variable-to-variable multiplications.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "Unit consistency is maintained throughout the model.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "Constraints are generally well-mapped to the problem description, but some details need clarification:\\n\\n1. Total Trucks Constraint: Matches the problem description.\\n2. GoodsX Trucks Constraint: Matches the problem description.\\n3. GoodsY Trucks Constraint: Matches the problem description.\\n4. GoodsZ Trucks Constraint: Matches the problem description.\\n5. Cost Reduction Constraint for GoodsZ: Matches the problem description.\\n6. Total Cost Reduction Constraint: Matches the problem description.\\n7. Investment Constraint: Matches the problem description.\\n\\nHowever, the following issues need attention:\\n- Placeholder values (0) in 'query' fields should be replaced with actual numbers.\\n- The 'query' fields contain placeholders (0) that should be replaced with actual numbers."
