{
    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.0,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The model contains significant errors and omissions that violate the specified guidelines. The queries do not match the problem description, and many constraints lack logical Big-M links and dimensional consistency.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "The 'orders_A', 'orders_B', and 'orders_C' variables should be Integer rather than Binary. The 'orders_A' variable should be Binary to correctly represent the decision to order from Supplier A.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerical discrepancies found in the 'LaTeX' fields compared to the 'query' fields. For example, 'Supplier_A_Price' should be '120', but 'LaTeX' is '1200'. Similarly, 'MinTables' should be '150', but 'LaTeX' is '1500'.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "Missing Big-M constraints for Supplier A and Supplier B. For instance, there is no link between 'orders_A' and 'orders_AAndB'.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "No variable-to-variable multiplication found, but the model is not strictly linear due to the presence of binary variables.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "The 'MaxTables' constraint uses '600' which is in tons, but the other constraints use '150' and '30' which are in tables. This inconsistency needs to be addressed.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "Constraints such as 'AtLeastThreeOrdersFromB', 'SupplierABDependent', 'SupplierBCDependent', 'SumOfOrdersFromAAndB', 'SumOfOrdersFromBAndC', and 'AtLeastSevenOrders' are logically inconsistent with the problem description. For example, 'AtLeastThreeOrdersFromB' and 'SupplierABDependent' both require 'x_B >= 3', which is redundant. Additionally, the 'MaxTablesFromA' constraint does not align with the problem statement that 'the total tables supplied from Supplier A can not exceed 60'."
