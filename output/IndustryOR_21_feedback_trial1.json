    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.0,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The model contains significant errors and omissions that violate the specified guidelines. The queries do not accurately reflect the problem description, and the mathematical formulation lacks integrity.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "The 'query' fields contain fabricated queries that do not match the problem description. For example, the 'Order_Count' constraint does not correctly reflect the minimum number of tables needed.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerous numeric values are missing or set to 0, leading to incomplete or incorrect equations. For instance, the'min_orders_A','min_orders_B','min_orders_total', and'max_tables_A' parameters are not properly aligned with their descriptions.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "No Big-M constraints are present, which is required for logical linking based on the problem description. Additionally, the 'Order_Count' and 'Order_Max' constraints do not enforce the minimum and maximum table requirements correctly.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The objective function and constraints are not linear due to the presence of binary variables and non-linear relationships. For example, the 'Order_Count' and 'Order_Max' constraints involve summations of binary variables multiplied by continuous variables.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "There is no dimensional analysis performed, which is crucial for ensuring units are consistent. For instance, the 'tables_A', 'tables_B', and 'tables_C' parameters should be converted to a common unit (e.g., tons to kilograms).",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "The constraints are poorly formulated and do not align with the problem description. For example, the 'Order_Count' constraint should ensure the total number of tables ordered meets the minimum requirement, but it currently only checks the total number of orders. Similarly, the 'Order_Max' constraint should limit the total number of tables ordered, not just the number of orders."
