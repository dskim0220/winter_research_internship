    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.0,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The model contains significant issues with grounding, logical coupling, and dimensional analysis. There are also errors in the objective function and constraints.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "The 'query' fields do not match the problem description. The following queries are hallucinations:\\n- 'bandwidth_AC'\\n- 'bandwidth_AD'\\n- 'bandwidth_BD'\\n- 'bandwidth_CD'\\n- 'bandwidth_DE'",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerical discrepancies found:\\n- 'bandwidth_AC' should be 85, but it is set to 0.\\n- 'bandwidth_AD' should be 67, but it is set to 0.\\n- 'bandwidth_BD' should be 30, but it is set to 0.\\n- 'bandwidth_CD' should be 25, but it is set to 0.\\n- 'bandwidth_DE' should be 56, but it is set to 0.\\n- 'transmission_efficiency_AE_direct' should be 10, but it is set to 0.\\n- 'transmission_efficiency_AE_indirect' should be 96, but it is set to 0.\\n-'min_bandwidth_AE_direct' should be 65, but it is set to 0.\\n-'min_bandwidth_AE_indirect' should be 80, but it is set to 0.\\n-'min_bandwidth_sum' should be 100, but it is set to 0.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "No Big-M constraints are correctly implemented. The 'efficiency_constraint_AE_direct' and 'efficiency_constraint_AE_indirect' should be linked to the 'link_AE_direct' variable using Big-M constraints.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The objective function does not follow the standard linear form. The correct form should be (Price - Cost) * Quantity - Fixed_Costs. However, the given formulation is incorrect.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "Unit inconsistencies exist. All parameters and variables should have consistent units. For example, 'bandwidth' should be in the same unit as 'link_AE_direct'.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "The constraints are poorly formulated and do not align with the problem description. The following constraints need to be revised:\\n-'sum_bandwidth_constraint': This constraint should ensure the total bandwidth is at least 100, but it is incorrectly formulated.\\n- 'indirect_bandwidth_constraint': This constraint should limit the indirect bandwidth to 80, but it is incorrectly formulated.\\n- 'direct_bandwidth_constraint': This constraint should ensure the direct bandwidth is at least 65, but it is incorrectly formulated.\\n- 'efficiency_constraint_AE_direct': This constraint should reflect the efficiency of the direct path, but it is incorrectly formulated.\\n- 'efficiency_constraint_AE_indirect': This constraint should reflect the efficiency of the indirect path, but it is incorrectly formulated."
