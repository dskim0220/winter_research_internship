    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerical values in the 'query' fields do not align with the LaTeX expressions. For example, the 'query' for 'path_i_length' does not contain the unit 'Length units', and the 'query' for 'path_i_turn_count' does not specify the unit 'Turn count'.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "No Big-M constraints are present in the provided JSON, which is expected since the problem does not mention fixed costs or minimum batch sizes.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The objective function is linear, but the constraints do not follow the linearity requirement. For instance, the 'Movement_Limitations' constraint involves a binary variable 't_i' multiplied by a continuous variable 'l_i', which is not allowed in a pure linear programming formulation.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "The unit consistency check is not applicable here as the problem description does not provide specific units for the variables.",
