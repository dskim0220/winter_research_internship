    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.0,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The provided JSON contains several issues that need to be addressed for it to be considered a valid and accurate representation of the problem. The grounding check, data fidelity check, logical coupling check, linear validation, dimensional analysis, and constraints feedback sections will highlight these issues.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "The 'query' fields do not match the problem description. The problem description mentions specific values like 5300, 4500, etc., but the JSON uses placeholders (e.g., 530000 for Demand_A1). Additionally, the 'query' fields do not include the fixed activation cost, minimum batch, and activation time constraints.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerous mismatches between the 'query' fields and the LaTeX expressions. For example, the 'query' fields mention specific values like 5300, 4500, etc., but the LaTeX expressions use placeholders (e.g., 530000 for Demand_A1). This indicates that the JSON is not grounded in the problem description.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "No Big-M constraints are included in the JSON, which is required for the minimum batch and activation time constraints. The JSON does not enforce the logic that if a product is produced, the production lines must be activated.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The objective function includes non-linear terms due to the binary nature of the decision variables \\(x_{i,t}\\). Specifically, the term \\(x_{i,t} \\cdot t_{i,t}\\) suggests a non-linear relationship, which is not allowed in a standard linear programming formulation.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "The unit conversion from tons to 100kg units is not explicitly handled in the JSON. The total production limit is given in tons (1210 tons), but the production cost and demand are given in 100kg units. This needs to be addressed in the JSON.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "The constraints for minimum batch and activation time are not correctly formulated. The JSON should include Big-M constraints to enforce these conditions. For example, the minimum batch constraint for product A1 would be something like \\(x_{A1,t} \\leq MB_{A1} \\cdot y_{A1,t}\\) where \\(y_{A1,t}\\) is a binary variable indicating whether the production line for A1 is activated in period t. Similarly, the activation time constraint should be formulated to ensure that if \\(y_{A1,t} = 1\\), then the production time for A1 must be at least 57 minutes."
