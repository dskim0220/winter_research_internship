    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.5,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The model contains several issues including incorrect usage of binary variables, lack of dimensional consistency, and logical errors. Additionally, the objective function and constraints need significant adjustments to accurately reflect the problem statement.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "The model uses arbitrary constants such as 'A_A1' and 'F_A1', which are not defined in the problem description. The activation time 'A_A1' should be replaced with a constant value based on the problem context.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "The model incorrectly uses binary variables for continuous decisions (e.g., 'x_A1', 'x_A2', 'x_A3'). The activation time constraint is also incorrectly formulated.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The model includes non-linear terms due to the multiplication of binary variables with continuous variables (e.g., 'x_A1 * 53 * 124'), which violates the requirements of Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP).",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "The units do not consistently match across the equations, particularly in the objective function and constraints.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "1) The binary variables 'x_A1', 'x_A2', and 'x_A3' should be replaced with continuous variables since they represent quantities rather than binary decisions.\n2) The activation time constraint is incorrectly formulated. The correct formulation should consider the minimum production batch and the fixed activation cost.\n3) The total production limit constraint should be adjusted to ensure it reflects the actual production capacity.\n4) The objective function should be redefined to maximize total revenue minus costs, considering the fixed activation costs and minimum production batches."
