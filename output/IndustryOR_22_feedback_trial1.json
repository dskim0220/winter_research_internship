{
    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.8,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The model largely adheres to the problem description but has some minor issues with variable type and logical coupling.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "No hallucinations found. All 'query' fields are faithful extracts from the problem description.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerical discrepancies found in the 'LaTeX' representation. Specifically, the 'MAX_DEMAND', 'PRICE', 'COST', 'ACTIVATION_COST', and 'MINIMUM_BATCH' parameters do not match the provided values in the problem description. Additionally, 'TOTAL_PRODUCTION_LIMIT' is not defined in the problem description.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "The 'Activation Time Constraint' and 'Minimum Batch Constraints' are correctly formulated using Big-M method. However, 'TOTAL_PRODUCTION_LIMIT' is not defined, which could lead to dimensional inconsistency.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The model is linear as there is no variable-to-variable multiplication.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "The 'MAX_DEMAND', 'PRICE', 'COST', and 'ACTIVATION_COST' parameters are in consistent units (100 kg, $/100 kg, $/100 kg, minutes). However, 'TOTAL_PRODUCTION_LIMIT' is not defined, leading to potential dimensional inconsistency.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "Constraints are generally well-mapped to the problem description. However, 'TOTAL_PRODUCTION_LIMIT' is not defined, which could cause issues. The 'Activation Time Constraint' and 'Minimum Batch Constraints' are correctly formulated using Big-M method."
