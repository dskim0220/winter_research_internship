    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.5,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The model is mostly grounded but lacks some critical details and logical consistency.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "No hallucinations found. All 'query' fields are faithful extracts from the problem description.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerical discrepancies found in the 'LaTeX' fields. Some numbers do not match the corresponding 'query' values. For example, 'REVENUE_PER_TEAM_APPX' should be 100000, but 'LaTeX' shows 100000. Similarly, 'MARKETING_COST_PER_TEAM_APPX' should be 20000, but 'LaTeX' shows 20000. This indicates potential data precision issues.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "No Big-M constraints are present in the current formulation. The logic for minimum batch and activation time is not explicitly linked in the constraints.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The model appears linear with no variable-to-variable multiplication. However, the objective function needs to be checked for linearity.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "Unit consistency is maintained throughout the model. All quantities are expressed in terms of teams.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "Constraints are generally well-mapped to the problem description. However, the following constraints need further verification:\\n- 'MIN_APPX_APPY_RATIO': This constraint is correctly formulated but requires a Big-M link.\\n- 'MAX_APPX_APPY_APPW_APPV_TEAMS': This constraint is correctly formulated but requires a Big-M link.\\n- 'MAX_APPZ_APPV_TEAMS': This constraint is correctly formulated but requires a Big-M link.\\n- 'MIN_APPX_TEAMS': This constraint is correctly formulated but requires a Big-M link.\\n- 'MARKETING_BUDGET': This constraint is correctly formulated but requires a Big-M link.\\n- 'TOTAL_TEAMS_AVAILABLE': This constraint is correctly formulated but requires a Big-M link."
