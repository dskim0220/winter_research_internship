    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.0,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The provided JSON contains several issues including incorrect variable types, logical errors, and missing constraints. The 'query' fields do not match the 'LaTeX' formulations, and the mathematical integrity is compromised.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "The 'query' fields contain placeholders (e.g., 0) instead of actual numbers. There are no hallucinations listed as the 'query' fields are not faithfully extracted from the problem description.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerical data is missing or set to 0. For example, the estimated revenue and cost values are not provided in the 'query' fields.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "No Big-M constraints are provided to link binary and continuous variables based on the logic in the queries.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "Variable-to-variable multiplication is present, violating the MILP standard. For instance, the objective function includes terms like (Price - Cost) * Quantity, which is not linear.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "No dimensional analysis is performed. The units of the parameters and variables are not consistent.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "The constraints are poorly formulated and do not align with the problem description. For example, the minimum batch constraint is missing, and the total production limit is not correctly specified."
