    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.5,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The model largely follows the problem description but lacks some critical details and logical checks.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "No hallucinations detected. All 'query' fields are faithful extracts from the problem.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerical discrepancies found in the 'LaTeX' representation compared to the 'query' fields. Specifically, the 'LaTeX' does not include the specific hourly wages and duty hours for each student.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "Missing Big-M constraints for minimum batch and activation time requirements. No 'M' value is defined in the 'LaTeX' or 'query' fields.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The objective function is linear, but the constraints do not enforce linearity due to the continuous nature of the variables and the absence of Big-M constraints.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "Unit consistency is maintained with the hourly wages and duty hours specified in the table.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "Constraints are mostly correctly formulated, but the following issues need attention:\\n1. Total hours undergraduates and graduate students should be checked against the specific hourly wages and duty hours.\\n2. Big-M constraints for minimum batch and activation time are missing.\\n3. The 'LaTeX' does not reflect the specific hourly wages and duty hours from the table."
