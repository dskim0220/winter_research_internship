    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The model largely follows the problem description but lacks specific numerical values and some constraints are not fully mapped.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "No hallucinations found. All queries are faithfully extracted from the problem description.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerical values in queries do not match those in LaTeX. Some values are placeholders (e.g., 0).",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "Missing Big-M constraints for minimum hours and activation time. No Big-M constraints for other conditions.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The model appears linear with no variable-to-variable multiplication.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "Unit consistency is maintained within the given data.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "Constraints are mostly correctly mapped to LaTeX, but some key details are missing or placeholders are used. Missing constraints include:\\n- Minimum hours for each student\\n- Total duty hours for all students\\n- Maximum combined hours for students 5 and 6\\n- Thursday limit for student 5\\n- Activation time constraints for students 5 and 6."
