{
    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.0,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The model contains significant issues with grounding, mapping, and logical integrity.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "The 'query' fields do not match the problem description. The problem description specifies specific employee requirements and constraints, but the 'query' fields contain placeholder values (e.g., 'EMPLOYEERS_REQUIRED', 'MIN_SUNDAY_MONDAY_PAIR', 'DIFFERENCE_LIMIT'). These placeholders should be replaced with actual numerical values.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerous numeric values are missing or set to 0. For example, 'EMPLOYEERS_REQUIRED' and 'MIN_SUNDAY_MONDAY_PAIR' should have actual numerical values, not placeholders. Similarly, 'DIFFERENCE_LIMIT' should be set to 7, not 0.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "No Big-M constraints are present in the model. The problem requires ensuring the difference between Monday and Wednesday employees is less than 7, which should be enforced with Big-M constraints. Additionally, the requirement for at least 3 employees with Sunday and Monday off should also be enforced with Big-M constraints.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The model appears linear, as there are no variable-to-variable multiplications.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "No dimensional analysis is performed in the given model. The problem involves continuous quantities (employee schedules), but the model uses continuous variables without specifying units.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "The constraints are poorly defined and do not align with the problem description. For example, the 'EmploymentRequirement' constraint does not specify the units for 'EmployeeSchedule' and 'EMPLOYEERS_REQUIRED'. The 'SundayMondayPairConstraint' is missing the Big-M formulation for the Sunday and Monday pair requirement."
