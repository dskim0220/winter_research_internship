{
    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.0,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The model contains several issues including incorrect variable types, logical errors, and missing constraints. The 'query' fields do not match the 'LaTeX' formulations, and some key parameters are missing.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "The 'query' fields contain placeholders and do not match the problem description. Specifically, 'EMPLOYEES_REQUIRED', 'MIN_DIFFERENCE', and 'SUNDAY_MONDAY_PAIR' are not defined in the problem description.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerical values in 'query' fields are placeholders (e.g., 15, 13, 15, etc.). These do not correspond to actual numbers in the 'LaTeX' formulations.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "No Big-M constraints are present in the model, which is expected given the current formulation. However, the model lacks critical constraints such as 'Minimum Batch', 'Total Production Limit (Tons)', and 'Activation Time'.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The model does not include any variable-to-variable multiplication, which is good. However, the model is not fully linear due to the presence of binary variables.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "No dimensional analysis is performed in the model. The units of 'EMPLOYEES_REQUIRED' and other parameters are not specified.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "The constraints are poorly formulated and do not align with the problem description. For example, the'shift_constraint_1' and'shift_constraint_2' do not correctly reflect the logic described in the problem. Additionally, the 'group_constraint' and 'employee_constraint' are redundant and should be simplified."
