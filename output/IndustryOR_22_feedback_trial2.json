    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.0,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The provided JSON lacks critical details and logical connections required for a proper mathematical optimization model. Additionally, the JSON structure does not align with the problem description and queries.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "The 'query' fields do not match the problem description. The problem description specifies specific values for demand, price, cost, quotas, and activation costs, but these are not reflected in the 'query' fields.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerical values in the 'query' fields are placeholders (e.g., 170000, 5300, etc.) and do not correspond to the actual values in the problem description. This results in zero-filling.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "No Big-M constraints are included to link the binary decision variables with the continuous production quantities and fixed costs.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The objective function does not follow the standard linear form due to the presence of binary variables and the lack of explicit linear terms for production quantities.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "The problem description uses tons as the unit of measurement, but the JSON does not convert this into 100 kg units as required. This inconsistency affects dimensional analysis.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "The constraints are not correctly formulated to reflect the problem description. For example, the total production limit is given in tons but the variables are defined in 100 kg units. Additionally, the activation time constraint is not properly translated into a binary decision variable context."
