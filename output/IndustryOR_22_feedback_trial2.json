    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.50,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The model attempts to capture the essence of the problem but contains several issues. The binary and continuous variable coupling is not clearly defined, and there are inconsistencies in the constraints and objective function.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "The model uses the exact numbers from the problem, but some constants like 'FixedActivationTime' are not defined in the problem statement.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "The coupling between binary and continuous variables is unclear. The constraint \( x_{A1} \geq \frac{T_{fixed}}{60} \) is problematic because 'T_fixed' is not defined in the problem statement.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "There is a non-linear term \( x_{A1} \geq 0.5 x_{A1} + 0.5 B_{A1} \). This term suggests a quadratic relationship which violates the MILP standard.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "The units do not consistently align across all equations. For example, the activation cost terms are in dollars per 100 kg, but the production cost terms are in dollars per 100 kg.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": {
        "Total Production Limit": "The constraint \( x_{A1} + x_{A2} + x_{A3} \leq L_{total} \) is correct, but \( L_{total} \) should be in units of 100 kg.",
        "Minimum Production Batch": "The constraints \( x_{A1} \geq B_{A1} \cdot B_{A1} \), \( x_{A2} \geq B_{A2} \cdot B_{A2} \), and \( x_{A3} \geq B_{A3} \cdot B_{A3} \) are incorrect. They suggest a quadratic relationship which is not present in the problem.",
        "Fixed Activation Time": "The constraint \( x_{A1} \geq \frac{T_{fixed}}{60} \) is problematic because 'T_fixed' is not defined in the problem statement.",
        "Daily Production Limit": "The constraint \( x_{A1} \geq 57 \) minutes is not appropriate. It should be related to the daily production limit of 22 days.",
        "Revenue Maximization": "The objective function \( \max P_{A1} x_{A1} + P_{A2} x_{A2} + P_{A3} x_{A3} - R_{A1} x_{A1} - R_{A2} x_{A2} - R_{A3} x_{A3} - C_{A1} x_{A1} - C_{A2} x_{A2} - C_{A3} x_{A3} \) is correct."
