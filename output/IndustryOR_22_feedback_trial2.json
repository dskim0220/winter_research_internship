{
    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.0,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The model contains several issues including incorrect variable types, logical errors, and missing constraints. Additionally, the objective function and constraints do not fully align with the problem description.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "The 'query' fields are not faithfully extracted from the problem description. The following queries are hallucinations:\n- 'produce_A1', 'produce_A2', 'produce_A3' should be 'produce_A1', 'produce_A2', 'produce_A3' respectively.\n- 'produce_A1', 'produce_A2', 'produce_A3' are incorrectly set as 'Binary' when they should be 'Continuous/Integer'.\n- 'produce_A1', 'produce_A2', 'produce_A3' are not correctly linked to the 'activate' logic.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerical mismatches and zero-filling are found in the 'LaTeX' compared to the 'query'. The following discrepancies are noted:\n- 'MAX_DEMAND' and 'PRICE' are correctly represented.\n- 'COST' is correctly represented.\n- 'ACTIVATION_COST' is correctly represented.\n- 'MIN_BATCH' is correctly represented.\n- 'TOTAL_PRODUCTION_LIMIT' is correctly represented.\n- 'FIXED_ACTIVATION_TIME' is correctly represented.\n- 'produce_A1', 'produce_A2', 'produce_A3' are incorrectly set as 'Binary' and not linked to the 'activate' logic.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "No Big-M constraints are correctly implemented based on the logic in the queries. The 'Fixed_Activation_Time' constraint is incorrectly formulated.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The model is not linear due to the presence of binary variables and non-linear terms like 'produce_A1 * MAX_DEMAND[A1]'.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "The unit conversion from tons to 100kg units is not performed consistently across the model.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "The constraints are poorly formulated and do not accurately reflect the problem description. The following issues are noted:\n- 'Total_Demand' constraint is incorrectly formulated.\n- 'Fixed_Activation_Time' constraint is incorrectly formulated.\n- 'Production_Limitation' constraint is incorrectly formulated.\n- 'Minimum_Batch' constraints are correctly formulated but redundant since 'produce_A1', 'produce_A2', 'produce_A3' are binary variables."
