    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "The 'query' fields do not correspond to the problem description. The queries are placeholders and do not reflect the actual problem requirements.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "No numeric values from the problem description are present in the 'LaTeX' section. All numbers are set to 0.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "No Big-M constraints are provided, which is required based on the problem description.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The model is not linear due to the presence of binary variables and the objective function structure.",
