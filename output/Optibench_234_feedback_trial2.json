    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.0,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The provided JSON contains significant issues with grounding, mapping, and logical integrity. The queries do not match the LaTeX formulations, and there are logical errors in the objective function and constraints.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "The 'query' fields do not faithfully reflect the content of the Problem Description. There are multiple instances where placeholders are used instead of actual numbers.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerical discrepancies found between the 'query' and 'LaTeX' fields. For example, the initial costs and reductions are not correctly represented in the LaTeX formulas.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "No Big-M constraints are present to link the binary decision variables with the continuous optimization investment. This is a critical oversight.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The objective function includes non-linear terms due to the multiplications involving binary and continuous variables, violating the standard Linear Programming (LP) requirements.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "There are inconsistencies in the dimensional analysis. For instance, the cost terms are not consistently converted to the same units (e.g., dollars vs. cents).",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "The constraints are poorly formulated and do not align with the problem description. For example, the minimum batch and total production limit constraints are not correctly expressed in the LaTeX formulations."
