{
    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.5,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The model largely follows the problem description but lacks some critical details and logical checks.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "No hallucinations found. All 'query' fields are faithful extracts from the problem.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerical discrepancies found. Some 'query' fields contain placeholder values (e.g., TIME_I_B3, TIME_II_B3, CAPACITY_B3, FIXED_COST_B3). These should be replaced with actual values from the table.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "No Big-M constraints are present in the model. This is a potential issue since some conditions require such constraints.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The model appears linear, but the absence of Big-M constraints means this cannot be confirmed without further analysis.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "Unit consistency is maintained throughout the model.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "Constraints are correctly mapped to their corresponding 'query' fields. However, the following constraints need more detailed scrutiny:\\n- Total production of Product I and III can not exceed 1,510.\\n- Total production of Product I, II, and III can not exceed 1,509."
