    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.0,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The provided JSON contains several issues that need to be addressed, including incorrect variable types, logical errors, and missing constraints.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "The 'query' fields do not match the problem description. The problem description mentions specific constraints and limits, which are not reflected in the 'query' fields.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerical values in the 'query' fields do not match those in the 'LaTeX' fields. For example, the fixed costs and production limits are placeholders (0) instead of actual numbers.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "No Big-M constraints are present in the provided JSON, which is required for the logical linking between binary and continuous variables.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "The objective function does not follow the standard linear form due to the presence of binary variables. Additionally, the constraints are not linear.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "There is no dimensional analysis performed in the provided JSON. The units of the parameters and constraints need to be consistent.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "The constraints are not correctly mapped to the 'LaTeX' formulation. For instance, the total production limits and minimum batch requirements are not properly represented."
