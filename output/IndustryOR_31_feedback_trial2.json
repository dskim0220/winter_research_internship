{
    "CONFIDENCE_SCORE": 0.0,
    "OVERALL_FEEDBACK": "The model lacks essential details and logical consistency. Key issues include incorrect variable types, missing constraints, and logical errors.",
    "QUERY_GROUNDING_AUDIT": "No hallucinations detected. However, some queries do not match the problem description.",
    "DATA_FIDELITY_CHECK": "Numerical discrepancies found. Some queries contain placeholders (e.g., 0) which should be replaced with actual values.",
    "LOGICAL_COUPLING_CHECK": "No Big-M links identified. This suggests potential logical errors in the formulation.",
    "LINEARITY_VALIDATION": "Potential non-linearities due to the continuous nature of production quantities and the absence of explicit linear terms.",
    "DIMENSIONAL_ANALYSIS": "Unit inconsistencies exist. For example, the fixed costs are in Yuan, but the production limits are in pieces.",
    "CONSTRAINTS_FEEDBACK": "Missing constraints such as minimum batch requirements, total production limit (tons), and activation time. Also, the objective function does not correctly reflect the profit calculation."
