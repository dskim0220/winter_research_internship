Based on the detailed formulation and constraints provided by my colleagues, here is the final Python code using the `pulp` library to solve the problem:

```python
import pulp

# Define the problem
prob = pulp.LpProblem("University_Duty_Planning", pulp.LpMinimize)

# Define the students and their details
students = {
    1: {'name': 'Student 1', 'wage': 10.0,'min_hours': 8},
    2: {'name': 'Student 2', 'wage': 10.0,'min_hours': 8},
    3: {'name': 'Student 3', 'wage': 9.9,'min_hours': 8},
    4: {'name': 'Student 4', 'wage': 9.8,'min_hours': 8},
    5: {'name': 'Student 5', 'wage': 10.8,'min_hours': 7},
    6: {'name': 'Student 6', 'wage': 11.3,'min_hours': 7}
}

# Define binary decision variables
x_ij = pulp.LpVariable.dicts('x', ((i, j) for i in students for j in range(1, 6)), cat='Binary')

# Define continuous variables for hours worked
y_i = pulp.LpVariable.dicts('y', [i for i in students], lowBound=0)

# Objective function: Minimize total pay
prob += pulp.lpSum(y_i[i] * students[i]['wage'] for i in students), "Total Pay"

# Constraints
# Work hours constraint for undergraduates
for i in students[1:5]:
    prob += pulp.lpSum(y_i[i] for i in students[1:5]) == students[i]['min_hours'], f"Undergraduate_{i}_hours"

# Work hours constraint for graduate students
for i in students[5:]:
    prob += pulp.lpSum(y_i[i] for i in students[5:]) == students[i]['min_hours'], f"Graduate_{i}_hours"

# Maximum shifts constraint
for i in students:
    prob += pulp.lpSum(x_ij[(i, j)] for j in range(1, 6)) <= 2, f"Max_Shifts_{i}"

# Daily maximum students constraint
for j in range(1, 6):
    prob += pulp.lpSum(x_ij[(i, j)] for i in students) <= 3, f"Daily_Max_Students_{j}"

# Total duty hours constraint
prob += pulp.lpSum(y_i[i] for i in students) == 70, "Total_Hours"

# Hours worked by students 5 and 6 constraint
prob += y_i[5] + y_i[6] <= 14, "Hours_Worked_5_and_6"

# Hours worked by student 5 constraint
prob += y_i[5] <= 2, "Hours_Worked_Student_5"

# Solve the problem
prob.solve()

# Print the results
print(f"Status: {pulp.LpStatus[prob.status]}")
for v in prob.variables():
    print(f"{v.name}: {v.varValue}")

print(f"Total Pay: {pulp.value(prob.objective)}")
```

To run this code, make sure you have the `pulp` library installed. You can install it using pip if needed:

```bash
pip install pulp
```

This code will output the optimal schedule for the students that minimizes the total pay while satisfying all the given constraints.
