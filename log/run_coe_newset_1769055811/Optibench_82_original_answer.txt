Based on the detailed formulation and the contributions from my colleagues, here is the final Python code using PuLP to solve the problem:

```python
import pulp

# Define the problem
prob = pulp.LpProblem("Employee_Scheduling", pulp.LpMinimize)

# Define the variables
employees = ['E1', 'E2', 'E3', 'E4', 'E5', 'E6', 'E7', 'E8', 'E9', 'E10']  # Adjust this list based on the actual number of employees
shifts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]  # Shifts correspond to Monday to Sunday
required_employees = {1: 15, 2: 13, 3: 15, 4: 18, 5: 14, 6: 16, 7: 10}

# Binary variables for employee availability
x = pulp.LpVariable.dicts('x', (employees, shifts), cat='Binary')

# Binary variables for employee assignment
y = pulp.LpVariable.dicts('y', employees, cat='Binary')

# Objective function: Minimize the number of employees
prob += pulp.lpSum(y[i] for i in employees), "Total Employees"

# Constraints
for i in employees:
    prob += pulp.lpSum(x[i][j] for j in shifts) == 5, f"Employee_{i}_availability"
    prob += pulp.lpSum(x[i][j] for j in shifts) <= 2, f"Employee_{i}_availability_limit"

for j in shifts:
    prob += pulp.lpSum(x[i][j] for i in employees) >= required_employees[j], f"Shift_{j}_requirement"

# Solve the problem
prob.solve()

# Print the results
print(f"Status: {pulp.LpStatus[prob.status]}")
print(f"Total Employees: {pulp.value(prob.objective)}")

# Display which employees are assigned to work
for i in employees:
    if y[i].value() > 0:
        print(f"Employee {i} is assigned to work.")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Variables**:
   - `x[i][j]`: A binary variable indicating whether employee `i` works on shift `j`.
   - `y[i]`: A binary variable indicating whether employee `i` is assigned to work at least one day.

2. **Objective Function**:
   - Minimize the total number of employees (`sum(y[i] for i in employees)`).

3. **Constraints**:
   - Each employee works exactly 5 days and has 2 days off (`sum(x[i][j] for j in shifts) == 5` and `sum(x[i][j] for j in shifts) <= 2`).
   - The total number of employees working on each day meets the required number (`sum(x[i][j] for i in employees) >= required_employees[j]`).

4. **Solution**:
   - The solution will provide the minimum number of employees needed and which employees are assigned to work.

### Running the Code
Ensure you have PuLP installed in your environment. If not, you can install it using pip:

```sh
pip install pulp
```

After running the code, you will get the status of the solution and the total number of employees. Additionally, the code will display which employees are assigned to work.

Feel free to adjust the list of employees (`employees`) based on the actual number of employees available.
