Based on the detailed formulation and constraints provided by your colleagues, here is the final Python code using PuLP to solve the problem:

```python
import pulp

# Define the problem
prob = pulp.LpProblem("Manufacturing_Planning_Problem", pulp.LpMinimize)

# Define decision variables
x1 = pulp.LpVariable('x1', lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')
x2 = pulp.LpVariable('x2', lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')
x3 = pulp.LpVariable('x3', lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')
x4 = pulp.LpVariable('x4', lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')

# Objective function: minimize the total number of hours
prob += x1 + x2 + x3 + x4, "Total_Hours"

# Constraints
# Production Constraints
prob += 10*x1 + 8*x2 + 6*x3 + 5*x4 >= 1000, "Smartphones_Constraint"
prob += 5*x1 + 6*x2 + 7*x3 + 8*x4 >= 800, "Tablets_Constraint"
prob += 3*x1 + 4*x2 + 5*x3 + 6*x4 >= 600, "Laptops_Constraint"

# Worker Capacity Constraints
prob += x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 <= 50, "Total_Workers_Constraint"
prob += x1 <= 20, "Line1_Capacity_Constraint"
prob += x2 <= 20, "Line2_Capacity_Constraint"
prob += x3 <= 20, "Line3_Capacity_Constraint"
prob += x4 <= 20, "Line4_Capacity_Constraint"
prob += x1 + x2 + x4 <= 30, "Combined_Workers_Constraint"
prob += x3 <= 10, "Line3_Specific_Constraint"

# Operational Line Constraints
prob += x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 >= 1, "AtLeastOneLine_Operational_Constraint"
prob += x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 <= 3, "NoMoreThanThreeLines_Operational_Constraint"

# Solve the problem
status = prob.solve()

# Print the results
print(f"Status: {pulp.LpStatus[status]}")
print(f"Total Hours Required: {pulp.value(prob.objective)}")

# Print the solution
print(f"x1: {pulp.value(x1)}, x2: {pulp.value(x2)}, x3: {pulp.value(x3)}, x4: {pulp.value(x4)}")
```

This code defines the problem, sets up the decision variables, and includes all the necessary constraints to ensure the company meets its daily production demands while adhering to the operational and capacity limits. The `solve` method is called to find the optimal solution, and the results are printed.
