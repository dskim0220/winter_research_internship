Given the problem statement, we need to formulate a linear programming model to minimize the amount of vitamin D while satisfying the constraints on nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and vitamin A. Here's the final code:

```python
import numpy as np

def prob_10(A, B, constraint1, constraint2, constraint3):
    """ 
    Args:
        A: an integer, kg of fertilizer A
        B: an integer, kg of fertilizer B
        constraint1: an integer, constraint 1 value (minimum 220 units of nitrogen)
        constraint2: an integer, constraint 2 value (minimum 160 units of phosphoric acid)
        constraint3: an integer, constraint 3 value (no more than 350 units of vitamin A)
    
    Returns:
        obj: an integer, amount of vitamin D
    """
    # Coefficients matrix
    coefficients_matrix = np.array([
        [13, 8],  # Nitrogen content per kg of A and B
        [5, 14]   # Phosphoric acid content per kg of A and B
    ])
    
    # Constants matrix
    constants_matrix = np.array([constraint1, constraint2])
    
    # Right-hand side vector
    rhs_vector = np.array([constraint3, 1e9])  # 1e9 is a large number to represent infinity
    
    # Number of variables
    num_variables = 2
    
    # Solve the linear programming problem
    solution = np.linalg.lstsq(coefficients_matrix, constants_matrix, rcond=None)[0]
    
    # Calculate the amount of vitamin D
    obj = 6 * solution[0] + 9 * solution[1]  # Vitamin D content per kg of A and B
    
    return int(obj)

# Example usage
A = 5  # kg of fertilizer A
B = 7  # kg of fertilizer B
constraint1 = 220  # Minimum 220 units of nitrogen
constraint2 = 160  # Minimum 160 units of phosphoric acid
constraint3 = 350  # No more than 350 units of vitamin A

min_vitamin_D = prob_10(A, B, constraint1, constraint2, constraint3)
print(f"The minimum amount of vitamin D is {min_vitamin_D} units.")
```

In this code, we use the `numpy` library to solve the linear programming problem. The objective is to minimize the amount of vitamin D, which is represented by the equation \(6x + 9y\), where \(x\) is the amount of fertilizer A and \(y\) is the amount of fertilizer B. The constraints are formulated based on the given requirements for nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and vitamin A. The solution is found using the least squares method, and the minimum amount of vitamin D is calculated accordingly.
