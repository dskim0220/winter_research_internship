Based on the problem description provided, we need to formulate a linear programming problem to maximize the profit from producing color and black and white printers. Given the constraints:

- The color printer team can produce at most 20 color printers per day.
- The black and white printer team can produce at most 30 black and white printers per day.
- The paper tray installing machine can make at most 35 printers of either type each day.
- Each color printer generates a profit of $200.
- Each black and white printer generates a profit of $70.

We can set up the linear programming model as follows:

Let \( x \) be the number of color printers produced.
Let \( y \) be the number of black and white printers produced.

Objective function (to maximize profit):
\[ \text{Maximize } P = 200x + 70y \]

Constraints:
1. \( x \leq 20 \)
2. \( y \leq 30 \)
3. \( x + y \leq 35 \)
4. \( x \geq 0 \)
5. \( y \geq 0 \)

Here is the final code implementing the above logic:

```python
def prob_1(color_printers, bw_printers):
    """ 
    Args:
        color_printers: an integer representing the number of color printers
        bw_printers: an integer representing the number of black and white printers
    
    Returns:
        obj: an integer representing the optimal objective value (profit)
    """
    # Objective function coefficients
    obj = [200, 70]
    
    # Constraints coefficients matrix
    A = [
        [1, 1],  # x + y <= 35
        [1, 0],  # x <= 20
        [0, 1],  # y <= 30
        [-1, 0], # -x >= 0
        [0, -1]  # -y >= 0
    ]
    
    # Constraints right-hand side values
    b = [35, 20, 30, 0, 0]
    
    # Solve the linear programming problem
    from scipy.optimize import linprog
    result = linprog(c=obj, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=[(0, None), (0, None)], method='highs')
    
    # Return the optimal objective value
    return int(result.fun)
```

This code uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the linear programming problem and returns the maximum profit.
