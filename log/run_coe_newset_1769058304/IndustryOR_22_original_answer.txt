Based on the detailed formulations provided by your colleagues, here is the final Python code using PuLP to solve the given problem:

```python
import pulp

# Problem definition
prob = pulp.LpProblem("Product_Production_Problem", pulp.LpMaximize)

# Decision variables
x1 = pulp.LpVariable.dicts('x1', range(1, 23), lowBound=20, cat='Continuous')
x2 = pulp.LpVariable.dicts('x2', range(1, 23), lowBound=20, cat='Continuous')
x3 = pulp.LpVariable.dicts('x3', range(1, 23), lowBound=16, cat='Continuous')

# Objective function
prob += pulp.lpSum([124*x1[d] + 109*x2[d] + 115*x3[d] for d in range(1, 23)]) - 170000 - 150000 - 100000, "Total_Revenue"

# Constraints
for d in range(1, 23):
    prob += x1[d] + x2[d] + x3[d] <= 5300 + 4500 + 5400, f"Production_Day_{d}"

for d in range(1, 23):
    prob += x1[d] <= 500, f"Prod_Qty_A1_Day_{d}"
    prob += x2[d] <= 450, f"Prod_Qty_A2_Day_{d}"
    prob += x3[d] <= 550, f"Prod_Qty_A3_Day_{d}"

# Solve the problem
prob.solve()

# Print results
print(f"Status: {pulp.LpStatus[prob.status]}")
print(f"Total Revenue: ${pulp.value(prob.objective)}")

for v in prob.variables():
    print(f"{v.name}: {v.varValue}")

for d in range(1, 23):
    print(f"Day {d}: A1={x1[d].varValue}, A2={x2[d].varValue}, A3={x3[d].varValue}")
```

### Summary of the Final Code
1. **Variables**: Defined three sets of decision variables `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` for each day from 1 to 22, representing the number of 100 kg units of products \(A_1\), \(A_2\), and \(A_3\) produced on each day.
2. **Objective Function**: Maximized the total revenue by summing up the revenues from each product and subtracting the fixed activation costs.
3. **Constraints**:
   - **Production Capacity Constraint**: Ensured that the total production over 22 days does not exceed the maximum demand.
   - **Daily Production Quota Constraint**: Ensured that the daily production of each product does not exceed its quota.
   - **Minimum Production Batch Constraint**: Ensured that the minimum number of 100 kg units that must be produced for each product is met.
   - **Non-negativity Constraint**: Ensured that the production quantities cannot be negative.
4. **Solving the Problem**: The problem is solved using PuLP's solver, and the results are printed out.

This code will output the optimal production plan and the maximum total revenue achievable under the given constraints.
