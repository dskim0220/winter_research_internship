Based on the detailed formulation and constraints provided, here is the final Python code to solve the problem:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import linprog

# Coefficients for the objective function (minimize)
c = [-120, -110, -100]  # Cost coefficients for Supplier A, Supplier B, and Supplier C respectively

# Coefficients for the inequality constraints
A = [
    [20, 0, 0],  # 20x_A <= 600
    [0, 15, 0],  # 15x_B <= 600
    [0, 0, 15],  # 15x_C <= 600
    [20, 0, 0],  # 20x_A >= 150
    [0, 15, 0],  # 15x_B >= 150
    [0, 0, 15],  # 15x_C >= 150
    [1, 1, 1],   # x_A + x_B + x_C >= 7
    [1, 0, 0],   # x_A <= 60
    [0, 1, 0],   # x_B <= 60
    [0, 0, 1]    # x_C <= 60
]

# Right-hand side values for the inequality constraints
b = [600, 600, 600, 150, 150, 150, 7, 60, 60, 60]

# Bounds for the variables (non-negative integers)
x_bounds = [(0, None), (0, None), (0, None)]

# Solve the linear programming problem
result = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=x_bounds, method='highs')

# Extract the solution
x_A, x_B, x_C = result.x
total_cost = -result.fun  # Since linprog returns the negative of the objective function value

print(f"Number of orders from Supplier A: {int(x_A)}")
print(f"Number of orders from Supplier B: {int(x_B)}")
print(f"Number of orders from Supplier C: {int(x_C)}")
print(f"Total cost: ${-total_cost:.2f}")
```

This code uses the `scipy.optimize.linprog` function to find the optimal number of orders from each supplier (`Supplier A`, `Supplier B`, and `Supplier C`) that minimizes the total cost while satisfying all the given constraints. The solution is rounded to the nearest integer since the number of orders must be an integer.
