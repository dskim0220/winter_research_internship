Based on the detailed formulation and constraints provided, here is the final Python code to solve the linear programming problem using `scipy.optimize.linprog`. This code will find the optimal allocation of development teams to maximize the average net profit per team while satisfying all the given constraints.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import linprog

# Coefficients of the objective function (negative because linprog minimizes)
c = [-40, -70, -100, -50, -90]  # Negative sign for maximization

# Coefficients of the inequality constraints
A = [
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],  # Total number of development teams available
    [1, -2, 0, 0, 0],  # AppX must have at least twice as many development teams as AppY
    [60, 80, 100, 70, 90],  # Marketing cost budget
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0],  # At least two teams are required to be assigned to the AppX development project
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0],  # Total number of development teams assigned to AppX, AppY, AppW, and AppV combined must not exceed 10 teams
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 1],  # Total number of development teams assigned to AppZ and AppV combined must not exceed 28 teams
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]  # Each product has at least one team working on it
]

# Right-hand side values of the inequality constraints
b = [30, 2, 2500000, 2, 10, 28, 1]

# Bounds for each variable (number of development teams)
x_bounds = [(1, None)] * 5  # Each product must have at least one team

# Solve the linear programming problem
result = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=x_bounds, method='highs')

# Extract the solution
solution = result.x
average_net_profit = result.fun

print(f"Solution: {solution}")
print(f"Average Net Profit: {average_net_profit}")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Objective Function**: The objective is to maximize the average net profit per team. The coefficients in `c` are negative because `linprog` minimizes the objective function. The objective function is formulated as:
   \[
   \frac{40x_X + 70x_Y + 100x_Z + 50x_W + 90x_V}{30}
   \]
   which simplifies to:
   \[
   40x_X + 70x_Y + 100x_Z + 50x_W + 90x_V
   \]

2. **Constraints**:
   - Total number of development teams available: \( x_X + x_Y + x_Z + x_W + x_V = 30 \)
   - AppX must have at least twice as many development teams as AppY: \( x_X \geq 2x_Y \)
   - Marketing cost budget: \( 60x_X + 80x_Y + 100x_Z + 70x_W + 90x_V \leq 2500000 \)
   - At least two teams are required to be assigned to the AppX development project: \( x_X + x_Y + x_W + x_V \geq 2 \)
   - Total number of development teams assigned to AppX, AppY, AppW, and AppV combined must not exceed 10 teams: \( x_X + x_Y + x_W + x_V \leq 10 \)
   - Total number of development teams assigned to AppZ and AppV combined must not exceed 28 teams: \( x_Z + x_V \leq 28 \)
   - Each product has at least one team working on it: \( x_X \geq 1 \)

3. **Solving the Linear Programming Problem**: The `linprog` function from `scipy.optimize` is used to solve the linear programming problem with the specified constraints and objective function.

This code will provide the optimal allocation of development teams to maximize the average net profit per team while adhering to all the given constraints.
