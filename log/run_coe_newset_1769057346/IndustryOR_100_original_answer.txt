Based on the detailed explanations and the code provided by the experts, here is the final Python code to solve the problem using PuLP:

```python
import pulp

# Define the problem
prob = pulp.LpProblem("Maximize_Bandwidth", pulp.LpMaximize)

# Define the nodes and their connections with bandwidths
nodes = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']
bandwidth_matrix = [
    [0, 90, 85, 0, 65],
    [95, 0, 70, 65, 34],
    [60, 0, 0, 88, 80],
    [67, 30, 25, 0, 84],
    [0, 51, 0, 56, 0]
]

# Define decision variables
x_AC = pulp.LpVariable('x_AC', cat='Binary')
x_CE = pulp.LpVariable('x_CE', cat='Binary')

# Define the objective function
prob += x_AC * min(bandwidth_matrix[0][2], bandwidth_matrix[2][4]) + \
        x_CE * min(bandwidth_matrix[2][4], bandwidth_matrix[4][4]) - \
        x_AC * x_CE * min(bandwidth_matrix[0][2], bandwidth_matrix[2][4])

# Define constraints
prob += x_AC + x_CE == 1, "PathFromAtoEThroughC"

# Solve the problem
prob.solve()

# Print the status of the solution
print(f"Status: {pulp.LpStatus[prob.status]}")

# Extract the maximum bandwidth
max_bandwidth = min(bandwidth_matrix[0][2], bandwidth_matrix[2][4]) if pulp.value(x_AC) == 1 else min(bandwidth_matrix[2][4], bandwidth_matrix[4][4])
print(f"Maximum Bandwidth: {max_bandwidth}")

# Print the values of the decision variables
print(f"x_AC: {pulp.value(x_AC)}, x_CE: {pulp.value(x_CE)}")
```

This code sets up the PuLP problem, defines the decision variables, the objective function, and the constraints. It then solves the problem and prints the status of the solution, the maximum bandwidth, and the values of the decision variables.

When you run this code, it will provide the optimal solution for the problem, including the status of the solution, the maximum bandwidth, and the values of the decision variables `x_AC` and `x_CE`.
