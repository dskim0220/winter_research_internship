Based on the insights from my colleagues, here is the final code to solve the problem using the `scipy.optimize.linprog` function to maximize the profit:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import linprog

# Coefficients of the objective function (we need to maximize profit)
c = [200, 70]

# Coefficients matrix for the inequality constraints
A = [
    [1, 1],  # A + B <= 35
    [1, 0],  # A <= 20
    [0, 1],  # B <= 30
    [-1, 0], # A >= 0
    [0, -1]  # B >= 0
]

# Right-hand side values for the constraints
b = [35, 20, 30, 0, 0]

# Bounds for the variables (A >= 0, B >= 0)
x0_bounds = (0, None)
x1_bounds = (0, None)

# Solve the linear programming problem
res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=[x0_bounds, x1_bounds], method='highs')

# Calculate the maximum profit
max_profit = res.fun

print(f"Optimal number of color printers: {res.x[0]}")
print(f"Optimal number of black and white printers: {res.x[1]}")
print(f"Maximum profit: ${max_profit}")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Objective Function**: We set up the objective function to maximize `200 * A + 70 * B`, where `A` is the number of color printers and `B` is the number of black and white printers.
2. **Constraints**:
   - `A + B <= 35`: Total number of printers cannot exceed 35.
   - `A <= 20`: Color printers cannot exceed 20.
   - `B <= 30`: Black and white printers cannot exceed 30.
   - `A >= 0`: Number of color printers must be non-negative.
   - `B >= 0`: Number of black and white printers must be non-negative.
3. **Bounds**: We set the bounds for both `A` and `B` to be non-negative.
4. **Solve**: Use `linprog` to find the optimal solution.
5. **Profit Calculation**: The maximum profit is calculated by evaluating the objective function at the optimal solution.

This code will output the optimal number of color and black and white printers to maximize the profit, along with the maximum profit amount.
