Based on the detailed comments and explanations provided by my colleagues, here is the final Python code using the `pulp` library to solve the problem:

```python
from pulp import LpProblem, LpMinimize, LpVariable, lpSum, LpInteger

# Define the problem
prob = LpProblem("Student_Duty_Planner", LpMinimize)

# Define the wage rates for each student
wages = {
    1: 10.0,
    2: 10.0,
    3: 9.9,
    4: 9.8,
    5: 10.8,
    6: 11.3
}

# Define the binary variables
x = {(i, j): LpVariable(f"x_{i}{j}", cat='Binary') for i in range(1, 7) for j in range(1, 6)}

# Define the binary variables for the constraints
y = {i: LpVariable(f"y_{i}", cat='Binary') for i in range(1, 7)}
z = {i: LpVariable(f"z_{i}", cat='Binary') for i in range(1, 7)}

# Objective function: Minimize total wage
prob += lpSum([wages[i] * x[(i, j)] for i in range(1, 7) for j in range(1, 6)])

# Constraints
# Each student works at most 2 shifts per week
for i in range(1, 7):
    prob += lpSum([x[(i, j)] for j in range(1, 6)]) <= 2 * z[i]

# Each student works at least 7 hours per week
for i in range(1, 7):
    prob += lpSum([7 * x[(i, j)] for j in range(1, 6)]) >= 7 * y[i]

# Each student works at least 8 hours per week
for i in range(1, 7):
    prob += lpSum([8 * x[(i, j)] for j in range(1, 6)]) >= 8 * y[i]

# No more than 3 students can be scheduled for duty each day
for j in range(1, 6):
    prob += lpSum([x[(i, j)] for i in range(1, 7)]) <= 3

# Each student must work at least one shift in the week
for i in range(1, 7):
    prob += lpSum([x[(i, j)] for j in range(1, 6)]) >= 1 * y[i]

# Each student works exactly 2 shifts in the week if z_i = 1
for i in range(1, 7):
    prob += lpSum([x[(i, j)] for j in range(1, 6)]) == 2 * z[i]

# Each student works at least one shift in the week if y_i = 1
for i in range(1, 7):
    prob += lpSum([x[(i, j)] for j in range(1, 6)]) >= 1 * y[i]

# Solve the problem
prob.solve()

# Print the status of the solution
print("Status:", LpProblem.status[prob.status])

# Print the results
for v in prob.variables():
    print(v.name, "=", v.varValue)

# Calculate the total cost
total_cost = 0
for i in range(1, 7):
    for j in range(1, 6):
        if x[(i, j)].varValue == 1:
            total_cost += wages[i] * 1

print("Total Cost:", total_cost)
```

This code defines the problem, sets up the binary variables, and includes all the necessary constraints and the objective function to minimize the total wage. The solution will provide the optimal schedule for the students that meets all the specified requirements and minimizes the total cost.
