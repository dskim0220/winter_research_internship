Based on the detailed problem description and the contributions from my colleagues, here is the final Python code using PuLP to solve the problem:

```python
import pulp

# Create a LP problem
prob = pulp.LpProblem("Manufacturing_Planner", pulp.LpMinimize)

# Decision variables
x1 = pulp.LpVariable('x1', lowBound=0, cat='Integer')  # Hours production line 1 is operational
x2 = pulp.LpVariable('x2', lowBound=0, cat='Integer')  # Hours production line 2 is operational
x3 = pulp.LpVariable('x3', lowBound=0, cat='Integer')  # Hours production line 3 is operational
x4 = pulp.LpVariable('x4', lowBound=0, cat='Integer')  # Hours production line 4 is operational

# Objective function
prob += x1 + x2 + x3 + x4, "Total_Hours"

# Constraints
prob += 10*x1 + 8*x2 + 6*x3 + 5*x4 >= 1000, "Smartphones_Constraint"
prob += 5*x1 + 6*x2 + 7*x3 + 8*x4 >= 800, "Tablets_Constraint"
prob += 3*x1 + 4*x2 + 5*x3 + 6*x4 >= 600, "Laptops_Constraint"
prob += x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 <= 50, "Total_Workers_Constraint"
prob += x1 <= 20, "Line1_Workers_Constraint"
prob += x2 <= 20, "Line2_Workers_Constraint"
prob += x3 <= 20, "Line3_Workers_Constraint"
prob += x4 <= 20, "Line4_Workers_Constraint"
prob += x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 >= 20, "AtLeastOneLineFullyStaffed_Constraint"
prob += x1 + x2 + x4 <= 30, "CombinedWorkersConstraint"
prob += x3 <= 10, "MaxStaffingConstraintForLine3"
prob += x1 >= 0, "NonNegativeConstraint"
prob += x2 >= 0, "NonNegativeConstraint"
prob += x3 >= 0, "NonNegativeConstraint"
prob += x4 >= 0, "NonNegativeConstraint"

# Solve the problem
status = prob.solve()

# Print the results
print(f"Status: {pulp.LpStatus[status]}")
print(f"Total Hours: {pulp.value(prob.objective)}")

if pulp.LpStatus[status] == 'Optimal':
    print(f"Solution: x1 = {pulp.value(x1)}, x2 = {pulp.value(x2)}, x3 = {pulp.value(x3)}, x4 = {pulp.value(x4)}")
else:
    print("No optimal solution found.")
```

This code sets up the problem with PuLP, defines the decision variables, the objective function, and the constraints based on the problem description. It then solves the problem and prints the status and the optimal solution if one exists.
