Based on the problem statement and the insights provided by my colleagues, we can formulate the linear programming problem and solve it using the `scipy.optimize.linprog` method. Here is the final code:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import linprog

# Coefficients of the objective function to minimize (negative of the coefficients in the original problem)
c = [-200, -70]  # Minimizing -P is equivalent to maximizing P

# Coefficients matrix for the inequality constraints
A = [
    [1, 1],  # x + y <= 35
    [1, 0],  # x <= 20
    [0, 1],  # y <= 30
    [-1, 0], # x >= 0
    [0, -1]  # y >= 0
]

# Right-hand side values for the inequality constraints
b = [35, 20, 30, 0, 0]

# Bounds for x and y (both must be non-negative)
x_bounds = (0, None)
y_bounds = (0, None)

# Solve the linear programming problem
result = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=[x_bounds, y_bounds], method='highs')

# Since we minimized the negative of the objective function, we need to negate the result to get the maximum profit
optimal_profit = -result.fun

print(f"Optimal number of color printers: {result.x[0]}")
print(f"Optimal number of black and white printers: {result.x[1]}")
print(f"Maximum profit: ${optimal_profit:.2f}")
```

This code sets up and solves the linear programming problem to find the optimal number of color and black and white printers to maximize the company's profit. The `linprog` function from `scipy.optimize` is used to solve the problem, and the solution is adjusted to reflect the maximization of profit.
